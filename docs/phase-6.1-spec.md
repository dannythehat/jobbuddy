# Phase 6.1: Natural Language Job Search - Feature Specification

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 6.1 introduces natural language job search capabilities, allowing users to search for jobs using conversational queries instead of traditional filters. This enhancement makes JobBuddi more intuitive and accessible to users of all technical levels.

## 🔍 Core Features

### 1. Natural Language Query Processing
**Goal:** Transform plain English queries into structured search parameters

**Examples:**
- "Find remote React developer jobs in London paying over £50k"
- "Show me part-time marketing roles near Manchester"
- "I want senior Python jobs with flexible hours"
- "Any data science positions at startups?"

**Technical Implementation:**
- OpenAI GPT integration for query understanding
- Query parsing and intent recognition
- Parameter extraction (location, salary, skills, etc.)
- Fallback handling for ambiguous queries

### 2. Intelligent Filter Translation
**Goal:** Convert natural language into existing filter system

**Supported Parameters:**
- **Location:** Cities, regions, countries, "remote", "hybrid"
- **Skills:** Programming languages, frameworks, tools
- **Salary:** Ranges, minimums, currency detection
- **Experience:** Junior, mid-level, senior, years of experience
- **Job Type:** Full-time, part-time, contract, internship
- **Company:** Size (startup, enterprise), industry, specific companies

### 3. Enhanced Search Interface
**Goal:** Seamless integration with existing search functionality

**Components:**
- Natural language search input with suggestions
- Query examples and help text
- Real-time query validation and feedback
- Hybrid search (NL + traditional filters)
- Search history and favorites

### 4. Smart Suggestions & Auto-completion
**Goal:** Guide users toward effective searches

**Features:**
- Query auto-completion based on common patterns
- Suggested refinements for better results
- Popular search templates
- Context-aware suggestions based on user profile
