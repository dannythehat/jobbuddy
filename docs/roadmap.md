### ✅ Phase 5: Production Launch (COMPLETED) 🎉
**Goal:** Production-ready platform with enterprise-grade infrastructure

**Security Hardening:**
- Comprehensive security middleware with rate limiting
- Helmet.js security headers and XSS protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- API key authentication system
- CORS configuration for production
- Request logging and monitoring

**Performance Optimization:**
- Redis caching system with memory fallback
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Database query optimization
- Response compression and caching middleware
- Memory usage tracking and optimization

**Production Infrastructure:**
- Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- Docker Compose production stack
- PostgreSQL and Redis services
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- SSL/TLS certificate management
- Health checks and monitoring

**Deployment & CI/CD:**
- Production environment configuration
- Automated deployment scripts
- Database migration scripts
- Backup and recovery systems
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

**Technical Implementation:**
- Production-ready package.json with security scripts
- Environment-specific configurations
- Container orchestration with Docker Compose
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Logging and error handling systems
- Performance metrics and alerting

### 🔄 Phase 6.1: Natural Language Job Search (95% COMPLETE)
**Goal:** Enable users to search jobs using natural language queries

**✅ Completed Components:**
- ✅ Backend natural language service with OpenAI integration
- ✅ API endpoints (`/api/nl/search/natural`, `/api/nl/search/parse`, `/api/nl/search/suggestions`)
- ✅ Database integration with Job model
- ✅ Query parsing and validation
- ✅ Frontend NaturalLanguageSearch component
- ✅ Component integrated into JobsPage
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Search UI with example queries

**⏳ Final Step (5% remaining):**
- ⏳ Replace mock handler with real API call in JobsPage
  - Current: `handleNaturalSearch` uses mock data
  - Needed: Call `naturalLanguageSearchService.searchJobs(query)` and handle response

**Features Implemented:**
- Natural language query parsing ("Find remote React jobs in London")
- Intelligent filter translation (location, skills, salary, remote work)
- Query validation and confidence scoring
- Search result relevance scoring
- Error handling with fallback suggestions
- Real-time search with loading states

**Technical Components:**
- OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo for query understanding
- Enhanced search API endpoints with multi-field filtering
- Natural language processing utilities
- Frontend search interface with Material-UI
- Query analytics and optimization
