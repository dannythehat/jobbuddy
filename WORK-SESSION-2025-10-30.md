- ✅ Documented all required changes with exact code and line numbers
- ✅ Includes:
  - Import statements
  - State management
  - Handler functions
  - UI tab addition
  - Complete tab content implementation

### 3. Updated Issue Tracking

## 📋 Next Steps (For Danny)

### Immediate Action Required
Apply the changes documented in `JobsPage-NL-Integration.patch.md` to `JobsPage.tsx`:

1. Open `frontend/src/pages/JobsPage.tsx`
2. Follow the patch file instructions section by section
3. Test the integration locally
4. Commit the changes

### After Integration
1. Test natural language search functionality
2. Verify results display correctly with match scores
3. Check error handling and loading states
4. Update Issue #20 with test results

## 📊 Phase 6.1 Stage 2 Status

**Overall Progress:** 70% Complete

### ✅ Done
- Backend API (100%)
- Frontend component (100%)
- Frontend service (100%)
- Integration documentation (100%)

### ⏳ Remaining
- Apply integration to JobsPage (requires local work)
- End-to-end testing
- Bug fixes if any
- Documentation updates

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Files Modified This Session
1. `frontend/src/pages/JobsPage-NL-Integration.patch.md` (created)

### Files To Be Modified (By Danny)
1. `frontend/src/pages/JobsPage.tsx` (apply patch)

### Integration Approach

## 📝 Notes

### Why Patch File Approach?
- `JobsPage.tsx` is 653 lines - exceeds GitHub API single-update limit
- Following AI-WORKFLOW.md guidelines for small batch updates
- Patch file provides clear, actionable instructions for local application

### Code Quality
- Maintains existing code patterns
- Reuses components and utilities
- Consistent with Material-UI design system
- TypeScript type safety maintained
